Project 1

1)
I hope the correct values are displayed. I have a feeling the average, between each read to print rate may be off.

The root directory of the program is in "proc/".
Just type "make" to compile the program.
The executable file is "./proc_parse"

2)
Currently, the pipe does not work. I was unable to get it to work properly and was unsure how to parse the correct commands and send them to another process.
Jobs should work correctly, but I get a <dsyfunc> when using "ps". From reading it suggest the the parent process is still running
when the child was terminated or interrupted. So, not sure if that is an issue or not.

The root directory of the program is in "shell/".
Just type "make" to compile the program.
The executable file is "./shell"
